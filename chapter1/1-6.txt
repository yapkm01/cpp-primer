std::cout << "The sum of " << v1;
          << " and " << v2;
          << " is " << v1 + v2 << std::endl;

Illegal since the second and third line does not have std::cout object for writing.
This is caused by the first line statement which terminated with a semicolon.
Removing the semicolon one first two line would fix it.
