When we use subscript operator instead of find, if a word is not in the map, it will be inserted into the map, and then transform into empty string, which is the value initialized value.
But we have the below code:

const string& transform(const string& s, const map<string, string>& m) {
    return m[s];
}

This would give an error since map m is a const and subscripts requires a non const map to create a record if s is not found in m.
