Sets are containers that store unique elements following a specific order.
Vectors are sequence array containers and are in the order you fill in AND can hold multiple identical items.

1. prefer set:
if you wish to filter multiple identical values.
if you wish to parse items in a specified order (doing this in vector requires to specifically sort vector).

2. prefer vector:
if you want to keep identical values.
if you wish to parse items in same order as you pushed them.
