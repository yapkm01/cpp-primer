auto p = new int();
auto sp = std::make_shared<int>();

1. Legal. Just copy sp which is a shared_ptr to process().
2. Illegal. Plain pointer can not convert to smart pointer implicitly.
3. Illegal. Plain pointer can not convert to smart pointer implicitly.
4. Legal. Initialize a shared pointer`ptr`inside function`process using ordinary pointer `p`, increase the reference count to 1. After the function is executed, destory `ptr` and decrease the reference count to 0, thus freed the memory pointed by `ptr`. However, the original ordinary pointer`p still points to that memory.
