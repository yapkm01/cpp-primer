1. keyword explicit prevents automatic conversion from an initializer_list to StrBlob. This design choice would easy to use but hard to debug.

Pros:
1. The compiler will not use this constructor in an automatic conversion.
2. We can realize clearly which constructor we have used.

Cons:
1. We always uses the constructor to construct a temporary StrBlob object.
2. Cannot use the copy form of initialization with an explicit constructor.
   Sales_data item1 (null_book); // ok: direct initialization
   Sales_data item2 = null_book; // error: cannot use the copy form of initialization with an explicit constructor
