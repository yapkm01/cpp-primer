Exercise 16.17:
What, if any, are the differences between a type parameter that
is declared as a typename and one that is declared as a class? When must
typename be used?

There is not difference between typename and class. They can be used
interchangeably, with one exception. Whenever we use the scope operator with a
template type parameter to access a type name we must use typename to tell the
complier explicitly that this is a type (not a static data member) we are
accessing.
