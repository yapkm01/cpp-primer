Exercise 16.8:
In the “Key Concept” box on page 108, we noted that as a matter
of habit C++ programmers prefer using != to using <. Explain the rationale for
this habit.

The library containers use function templates to define their member functions.
Given the generic nature of function templates, the containers share the same 
code for such operation. However, the ability to share a common template code
deepened on the class implementation of certain overloaded operators. Since more
classes define != rather than < would mean fewer function templates definitions
are needed to support the operations.
