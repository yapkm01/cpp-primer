Exercise 2.1:
What are the differences between int, long, long long, and short?
Between an unsigned and a signed type? Between a float and a double?

1. sizeof(short) <= sizeof(int) <= sizeof(long) <= sizeof(long long)
2. a signed type represents negative or positive numbers (including zero).
   An unsigned type represents only values greater than or equal to zero
3. float represent single precision while double of double precision
