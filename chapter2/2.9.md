Exercise 2.9:
Explain the following definitions. For those that are illegal,
explain what's wrong and how to correct it.

(a) std::cin >> int input_value;
(b) int i = { 3.14 };
(c) double salary = wage = 9999.99;
(d) int i = 3.14;

(a) - error: expected primary-expression before ‘int’
    - int input_value should be declared (possibly defined) prior to usage

(b) - error: narrowing conversion required which is an error in list initialization standard
    - use int i (3.14); or int i = 3.14;

(c) - error: ‘wage’ was not declared in this scope
    - double wage = 9999.99, salary = wage;

(d) - ok but truncated
