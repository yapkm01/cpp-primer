definition:
1. the pointer is "points to" any other type.
2. the reference is "another name" of an object.

key difference:

1. a reference is another name of an already existing object. a pointer is an object in its own right.
2. Once initialized, a reference remains bound to its initial object. There is no way to rebind a reference to refer to a different object. a pointer can be assigned and copied.
3. a reference always get the object to which the reference was initially bound. a single pointer can point to several different objects over its lifetime.
4. a reference must be initialized. a pointer need not be initialized at the time it is defined.
