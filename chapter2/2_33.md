Definition	Type / Value					Result
a = 42		a is an int, it's value is 42.			Legal.
b = 42		b is an int, it's value is 42.			Legal.
c = 42		c is an int, it's value is 42.			Legal.
d = 42		d is an int*, it holds the address of i.	Illegal, needs to be dereferenced to assign a value.
e = 42		e is a const int*, it holds the address of ci.	Illegal, pointed to type is const.
g = 42		g is a const int&, it refers to ci.		Illegal, referred to type is const.
