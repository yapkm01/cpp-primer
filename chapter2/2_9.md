(a) std::cin >> int input_value;
    - error: expected primary-expression before ‘int’
    - int input_value should be declared (possibly defined) prior to usage

(b) int i = {3.14};
    - error: narrowing conversion required
    - use int i (3.14); or int i = 3.14;

(c) double salary = wage = 9999.99;
    - error: ‘wage’ was not declared in this scope
    - double wage = 9999.99, salary = wage;

(d) int i = 3.14;
    - ok but truncated
