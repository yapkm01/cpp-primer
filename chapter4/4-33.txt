someValue ? ++x, ++y : --x, --y
Because of the most lowest precedence of the comma operator, the expression is same as:

(someValue ? ++x, ++y : --x), --y
If someValue is true, then ++x, and the result is y, if someValue is false, then --x, and the result is --y. so it is also same as:

someValue ? (++x, y) : (--x, --y);
Even though the result has nothing to do with x, the evaluation of someValue does effect the operation on x.
