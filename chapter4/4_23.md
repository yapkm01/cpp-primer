Since the addition and equality operators have higher precedence than the conditional ?: operator the code as shown could also be written as:

string pl = (s + s[s.size() - 1]) == 's' ? "" : "s";
It is trying to compare a string to a char ("wordd" == 's'). To fix this we simply parenthesise the conditional code

string pl = s + (s[s.size() - 1]) == 's' ? "" : "s");
