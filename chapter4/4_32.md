constexpr int size = 5;
int ia[size] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
for (int *ptr = ia, ix = 0;
    ix != size && ptr != ia+size;
    ++ix, ++ptr) { /* ... */ }

ptr and ix have the same function. The former use a pointer, and the latter use the index of array. we use the loop to through the array.(just choose one from ptr and ix)
