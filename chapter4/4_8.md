The logical AND and OR operators always evaluate their left operand before the right. Moreover, the right operand is evaluated if and only if the left operand does not determine the result. This strategy is known as short-circuit evaluation.

logical AND : the second operand is evaluated if and only if the left side is true.
logical OR : the second operand is evaluated if and only if the left side is false
equality operators : true only if both operands have the same value, otherwise, it returns false.
