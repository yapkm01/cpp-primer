The first operand is true if cp is not a nullptr, the second operand is true if the dereferenced value of cp is not empty or zero. Due to the nature of the logical AND operator this code will not attempt to dereference a null pointer (it will short-circuit after failing the first evaluation). Since cp is a valid pointer (true) and *cp = H (true) the result of this statement is true.
