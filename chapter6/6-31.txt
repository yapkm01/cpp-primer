A reference can only be returned when the function return type is a reference. A reference should only be returned when it refers to a pre-existing object. For a const reference it is the same as above except it should be used when the referred to object doesn't need to be modified.

Never return a reference to a (temporary) variable within a function as it will be removed from memory once the function ends.
