In this example the parameter ia is actually of type const int*. Since an array, when used as a parameter, is converted to a pointer to the first element in that array. The body of this function is therefore in error since we cannot guarantee there will be 10 elements. It could even be a plain int. To fix this we need to enforce and array of 10 elements; we do this by changing the parameter to be a reference to an array of 10 ints like so:

void print(const int (&ia)[10]) {
    for (size_t i = 0; i !=10; ++i)
        cout << ia[i] << endl;
}
Note that this version of the function is very restrictive; it can only be used with arrays of size 10.
