A good way to find the differences, especially when it comes to recursive functions, is to add some cout statements to output info at each stage though the recursion.

int factorial(int val) {
    static int run_count = 0;
    ++run_count;
    // Change this to != 0 and try again
    if (val > 1) {
        cout << val << " x ";
        return factorial(val - 1) * val;
    }
    // Here val is always 1 because of the explicit return value below
    cout << 1 << endl;
    cout << "Function has been run " << run_count << " times.\n";
    return 1;
}

int main() {
    cout << factorial(5) << endl;
    return 0;
}

Sample output:

5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1
Function has been run 5 times.
120
Compare this with the output from the altered condition (val != 0):

5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 x 1
Function has been run 6 times.
120
We can see that the function was called an extra time. Fortunately since the returned value is 1 it doesn't change the end result. There is however a major issue if a negative number is supplied to the function. In the altered version, supplying a negative will cause an infinite loop since val will never equal zero.
