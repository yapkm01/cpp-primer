(a)
Top level const is ignored. Declarations are identical. However it's legal for repeated declaration without definition.

(b)
Simply changing the return type of an overloaded function does not differentiate it from the original declaration. The second declaration is in error.

(c)
These definitions are legal, the parameter lists are different - one resets and int value, the other a double.
