a)
Illegal, no argument has been supplied for ht.

(b)
Legal. ht = 24, wd = 10, bckgrnd = ' '.

(c)
Legal but probably not what the programmer intended. Since the parameter list is positional the * character instead of being used for bckgrnd is converted to an int, 42, and used to provide a value for wd. bckgrnd is set using the default value ' '.
