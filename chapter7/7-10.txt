We work this one from the inside out. First the inner read reads data into data1 it then returns a reference to an istream object (as per our header file from the previous exercise) which is then used as the input to feed data to data2.

This statement will betrue only if there is enough data to satisfy both data1 and data2, it will be false otherwise.
