If these member functions are not const the following would be illegal

const Person andy;
cout << andy.get_address() << endl;
Since andy is a const Person he can only call member functions with the same constness.

If we define these member functions to be const both a const Person and a Person (non const) can utilise them. Having const member functions effectively increases their flexibility.
