There is no limit on how many times an access specifier can appear within a struct or class. Each definition following a specifier has the specified 'visibility' until either the next specifier or end of class is reached.

The constructors and member functions that are part of the interface should be defined after a public specifier.

The data members and member functions that are part of the implementation should be defined after a private specifier.
