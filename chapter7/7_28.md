If we aren't dealing with a reference to a Screen object, we would then be using a copy instead. Changes to this temporary copy will not change the original object. In the case of the example code from the exercise above, here's what happens:

Screen myScreen(5, 5, 'X');
myScreen.move(4,0).set('#').display(cout);
cout << "\n";
Here we construct myScreen, a 5 x 5 screen filled with the char 'X'. On the second line we chain 3 methods, first we move the cursor to the 4th row, then we replace the 'X' at that location with a '#', then we print the output. Now, since we are not using references, all these actions take place on the temporary copy of the myScreen object. No change is made to the original myScreen object.

Output of the above code:
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX#XXXX

myScreen.display(cout);
cout << "\n";
Here we call display on the original object thus yielding the original unchanged screen:
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
