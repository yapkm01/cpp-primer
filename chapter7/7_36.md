In this case, the constructor initializer makes it appear as if base is initialized with i and then base is used to initialize rem. However, rem is initialized first. The effect of this initializer is to initialize rem with the undefined value of base!

fixed

struct X {
  X (int i, int j): base(i), rem(base % j) {}
  int base, rem;
};

or

struct X {
  X (int i, int j): base(i), rem(i % j) {}
  int rem, base;
};
