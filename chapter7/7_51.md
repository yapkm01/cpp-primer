Using below function as an example:

int getSize(const vector<int> &);
if vector has not defined its single-argument constructor as explicit. we can use the function like:

getSize(34);
What does this mean? It's very confusing.

But the string is different. In ordinary, we use string to replace const char *(the C language). so when we call a function like that:

void setYourName(string); // declaration.
setYourName("pezy"); // just fine.
it is very natural.
