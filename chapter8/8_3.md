The condition of a stream is equivalent to !fail(), which means set either failbit or badbit will terminate the loop.
For example, errors list below will terminate the loop:

System-level failure. (badbit) Such as an unrecoverable r/w error.
Recoverable error. (failbit) Such as reading a character when numeric data expected.
Reaching end-of-file. (eofbit)
