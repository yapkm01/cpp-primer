The constructor that takes another container as an argument (excepting array) assumes the container type and element type of both containers are identical. It will also copy all the elements of the received container into the new one:
	list<int> numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
	list<int> numbers2(numbers);        // ok, numbers2 has the same elements as numbers
	vector<int> numbers3(numbers);      // error: container type differs
	list<double> numbers4(numbers);     // error: element type differs

The constructor that takes two iterators as arguments does not require the container types to be identical. Moreover, the element types in the new and original containers can differ as long as it is possible to convert the elements weâ€™re copying to the element type of the container we are initializing. It will also copy only the object delimited by the received iterators.
	list<int> numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
	list<int> numbers2(numbers.begin(), numbers.end);        // ok, numbers2 has the same elements as numbers
	vector<int> numbers3(numbers.begin(), --numbers.end());  // ok, numbers3 is { 1, 2, 3, 4 }
	list<double> numbers4(++numbers.beg(), --numbers.end());        // ok, numbers4 is { 2, 3, 4 }
	forward_list<float> numbers5(numbers.begin(), numbers.end());   // ok, numbers5 is { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }
