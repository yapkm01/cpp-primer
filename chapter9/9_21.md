The member function insert(p, t) has the same effect on both list and vector containers which is inserting in front of the elements
pointed by iter, but the cost is different.  Inserting an element into list is cheap, while inserting an element into vector will 
cause all the elements after the newly inserted element be moved. Thus every time the while loop body is executed, all elements in 
the vector possibly are moved backward, and new element is inserted in the front of the vector.
