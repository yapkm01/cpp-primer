The while loop will read words from cin and store them in out vector. Even if we initially reserved 1024 elements, if there are 
more words read from cin, our vector's capacity will be automatically increased (most implementations will double the previous 
capacity) to accommodate them. And now comes the catch. resize() is different from reserve(). In this case resize() will add 
another svec.size()/2 value initialized elements to svec. If this exceeds svec.capacity() it will also automatically reallocate
it to accommodate the new elements.
